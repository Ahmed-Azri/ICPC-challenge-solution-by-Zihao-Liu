Note that my solution have never pass through the verdict, even though I have tested every input I have searched.

The algorithm is as follows:

Construct graph first from the input and then removing the root node(with n incomming edges) until no node is present.

If you have any suggestions as to where is wrong with the algorithm, feel free to email me at zliu224@wisc.edu
